# Depression-Detection
The drive to comprehend and address the emotional well-being of young adults is of paramount
importance, given its profound implications for their overall life quality. Among this age group,
there is a noticeable increase in anxiety, depression, and mood disorders, just to name a few.
Detecting these problems in their initial stages is crucial for preventing their progression into more severe conditions with lasting repercussions.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) has emerged as a promising tool in the field of mental health
assessment and intervention. NLP encompasses the use of computational techniques to analyze
and interpret human language, enabling the extraction of valuable insights from large volumes of
textual data.
